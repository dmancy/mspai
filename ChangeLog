	* Made 1.2.0 release

	* src/Cache.*: Optimized caching algorithm, 
	less data copies and LRU update mechanism 
	is provided internally.

	* src/Spai_SD.*: Added subalgorithm for
	sparse decompositions, can be invoked using
	option -qr 5 and runs bugfree and a bit 
	faster instead of old version in 
	qrupdates.cpp.

	* src/Spai_Sub.*: Optimized runtime of many 
	algorithm parts: Eliminated bottlenecks due
	to memset() function. For large matrices of
	dimension > 100k the memsets slowed down the
	algorithm heavily on various architectures. 
	Additionally avoiding memset for small size 
	of indices and nnz in specific column when
	using pattern updates. For small products 
	first experiments showed that this is much 
	faster. 

	* src/Spai_Sub.*: Removed Bugs which lead
	to Lapack and thus MSPAI crashes due 
	to wrong minimum bounds for the Lapack 
	routines.

	* src/Read_mm_Matrix.*: Removed Bug for
	symmetric matrices. Only half of the matrix
	was generated and thus MSPAI computed wrong
	output and/or chrashed for empty index sets 
	and submatrices. Mathematically MSPAI does not
	preserve symmetry but technically it now
	works correct. An extra warning in case of 
	symmetric input	is streamed to shell.

	* src/Read_mm_Matrix.*: For hermitian
	matrices the read procedure now correctly
	expand the conjugate complex part of the 
	input system. 

	* src/Pattern.*: Removed bug for 
	symmetric patterns which were given as 
	file in MatrixMarket format only half 
	of the pattern was generated.   

	* src/Command_Line.*: Additional optional
	parameter available "-out". With this
	parameter one can specify the output file
	where to store the preconditioner. Default
	value is still "precond.mtx" in the current
	working directory.

	* src/Matrix.*, src/Pattern_Switch.*: 
	Optimized IO for generating Pattern data. 
	If user requests Pattern of the input system
	P(A) there is no longer a second pass through
	the input matrix to generate the pattern. 
	Instead the Pattern is generated internally
	from the created Matrix object. This becomes 
	especially noticable for large matrices beyond 
	a size of 10^5 where the matrix is no longer
	read twice.

	* src/Spai.imp, src/Command_Line.*: 
	Adjusted shell output stream: Now the 
	shell output is clear that a MSPAI is 
	being computed. This was a bit misleading: 
	one could think of a kind of suspension 
	because no information was displayed when 
	computing the MSPAI. Furthermore a Copyright
	and a short License reference message is 
	displayed at the startup.
	Added some basic colours to improve the 
	readability of the output.
	For symmetric matrices a short warning
	is displayed.

	* src/Read_mm_Matrix.*: Program crashed
	in LAPACK routines when using singular 
	matrices. Added singularity check of 
	input data for controlled abort of 
	the program with shell message.

	* src/main.cpp: In case of bad memory
	allocation an additional notice is 
	streamed to shell. Using a diagonal
	start pattern or reduced dynamic 
	parameters the program will possibly 
	not run into a lack of memory. 
	Customized other shell output.
