== 1)     Web Resources     ==
==============================

MSPAI's home page with the latest version is at:

    http://www5.in.tum.de/wiki/index.php/MSPAI

Please be sure to visit this site for information, documentation,
news, etc.  All things concerning MSPAI are available from there.



==============================
== 2) Installation of MSPAI ==
==============================

Unfortunately, there is no common configure script and no common 
installation package at the moment. As soon as there will be any 
user-friendly installation process this will be changed immediately.

There is a stand-alone serial as well as parallel version of the 
MSPAI 1.2, each in a seperate directory called 'mspai-1.2-parallel' 
for the parallel version and 'mspai-1.2-serial' for the serial version. 


1) MSPAI uses the following libraries/standards:
	- CSparse ( http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/CSparse/ )
	- LAPACK  ( http://www.netlib.org/lapack/ )
	- MPI for the parallel version ( http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/  )
2) Decide which version you want to use (serial or parallel).
3) Enter the directory.
4) Adapt the 'Makefile' in the directory 'src':
	- Adapt the library specifications (e.g. lapack)
5) Type 'make' in the 'src' directory.
6) The 'mspai' executable  will appear in the 'bin' directory.


You can find more information about MSPAI 1.2 in the MSPAI documentation
in the 'doc' directory.



==============================
== 3)    Usage of MSPAI     ==
==============================

Please refer to section 2.2 'How to run MSPAI 1.2' of the MSPAI 
documentation 'mspai-1.2.pdf' in the 'doc' directory.
